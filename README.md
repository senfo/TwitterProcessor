A simple demo project for demonstrating Storm and Spark API using Twitter
data. I am a C#, JavaScript, Ruby convert and new to Storm/Spark, so I expect
criticism of some sort. Since this is intended to be used by others who are also
new to the platforms, please feel free to submit pull requests to improve upon
the quality of the project.

In order to run the demos, you must modify the sample-config.xml file (included)
with your own Twitter app values from http://dev.twitter.com and save them to a
resource file named config.xml.
